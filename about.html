      <p>
         Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides.
         Prides are family units that may include up to three males, a dozen or so females, and their young.
         All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age.
         Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.
       </p>
       <p>
          Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.
          Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.
          The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.
          Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.
          Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.
       </p>
       <p>
           Lions stand between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 and 1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder.
           Males grow to lengths of 10 feet (3 meters) and have a 2 to 3 foot (60 to 91 centimeter) tail.
           They weigh from 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms). Slightly smaller, females grow to lengths of 9 feet (2.7 meters) and weigh between 265 and 395 pounds.

           Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest.
           Except for a small population of the Indian lion subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa.
           They are absent from equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical forest.

       <h2 class="section-head">Lion Pride And Hunting</h2>
       <p>
         Only male lions boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads.
         Males defend the pride's territory, which may include some 100 square miles of grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands.
         These intimidating animals mark the area with urine, roar menacingly to warn intruders, and chase off animals that encroach on their turf.
       </p>
       <p>
         Female lions are the pride's primary hunters.
         They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands.
         Many of these animals are faster than lions, so teamwork pays off.
       </p>
       <p>
         After the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the kill, with cubs at the bottom of the pecking order.
         Young lions do not help to hunt until they are about a year old.
         Lions will hunt alone if the opportunity presents itself, and they also steal kills from hyenas or wild dogs.
       </p>
       <p>
         Lions are the world's most social felines.
         They live in groups of related females, called prides, which may comprise several to as many as 40 individuals, including adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males.
         Abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. Pride mates associate in sub-groups within the pride.

         Females usually stay in their mothers' prides for life, unless food scarcity forces them out.
         Young males are driven from their prides when they grow large enough to compete with the dominant males (usually between the ages of 2 and 4).
         They create coalitions, usually with brothers and cousins, and search for a pride to take over. Males entering a new pride will kill all cubs that cannot run from them.
         Adult males that are fortunate enough to achieve residency within a pride hold tenure for an average of two years, often leaving due to eviction by another coalition of males.
         In India, female and male lions live apart, joining only to mate.
       </p>
       <p>
         Males take on most of the defensive duties.
         However, both males and females mark their territories by roaring — which can be heard up to five miles away — and scent marking with urine.
         Females raise the cubs and are the primary hunters, although males will sometimes join females during a hunt.
         Depending on the prey item, several lions may stalk prey from different angles to within 100 feet (30 meters) before attacking the targeted animal.
         Nomadic males must hunt alone or scavenge from other animals.
